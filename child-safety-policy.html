    <h1>Child Safety Standards</h1>
    <p>
        At <strong>Ume</strong>, the safety and well-being of children is a top priority. We have a strict zero-tolerance policy against any form of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) or Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE).
    </p>

    <p>
        Our app uses a combination of human review, and community reporting features to proactively detect and remove inappropriate content that may violate child safety laws. Any user who is found to be violating these standards is immediately banned and reported to the appropriate authorities.
    </p>

    <p>
        Users can easily report any suspicious or abusive content within the app. Every report is promptly reviewed by our safety team. In cases where CSAM is identified, we report it to regional or national child protection and law enforcement authorities in accordance with applicable laws.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ume is fully committed to complying with all relevant child safety regulations and international reporting obligations, including those set by local cybercrime units and child protection agencies.
    </p>
