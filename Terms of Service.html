<h1>Terms and Conditions of Use</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Effective Date: June 4, 2025</h2>

<p>Hello and welcome to Ume!</p>

<p>We’re excited to have you here. These Terms and Conditions ('Terms') explain how you can use our app and what you can expect from us — and what we expect from you. By using this app, you're agreeing to these terms. If you ever have any questions, feel free to reach out — we’re here to help!</p>

<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Ume If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Ume</p>

<h2 style="color: #2196F3;">The Ume Service</h2>

<p>We agree to provide you with the Vivi Service. The Service includes all of the Ume services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Vivi's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things that you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:</p>

<h3>1. Profile Creation and Editing</h3>
<p>You can create a personal profile with photos, interests, and a short bio to showcase your personality.</p>

<h3>2. Virtual Blind Date Interface</h3>
<p>You will get a chat interface where you chat with people of opposite gender from your city who are active/online at that particular time. Profiles will be shown to both the users involved in the chat conversation only when both the users agree to show their profile. After profiles are revealed both the users can add the other user to their chat list.</p>

<h3>3. Fun Chat Interface</h3>
<p>You will get a chat interface where you chat with people of opposite gender from over the entire Vivi community who are active/online at that particular time. Profiles will be shown to both the users involved in the chat conversation only when both the users agree to show their profile.</p>

<h3>4. Card Swiping</h3>
<p>You will get profile cards of people from your city. If all cards from the city where you belong are seen by you, then the app automatically resets all the profile cards which you have seen. Right Swipe means the particular profile is of interest whereas left means not interested. (If you are a female user you will get male profiles and if you are a male user you will get female profiles)</p>

<h3>5. Photo Sharing</h3>
<p>You can share your photos by using the Add Post interface along with a caption (optional). Photos will be shown strictly as portrait.</p>

<h3>6. Photo Gallery</h3>
<p>You can see, Like, Complement on photos of people of opposite gender from over the entire Vivi community which means others will see, like, complement on your photos as well. You can view user profile and the user whose profile is being viewed will be notified.</p>

<h3>7. Chat &amp; Messaging</h3>
<p>You choose to start or ignore conversations with users who right swiped you by adding them to the chatlist from swipe notifications. If a user creates trouble for you in any means on this app, you can simply delete the user from the chatlist and that user will not be able to contact you any further on this app.</p>

<h3>8. Profile Music</h3>
<p>You can add music to your profile from the collection of Royalty Free Songs from Pixabay.com.</p>

<h3>9. Push Notifications</h3>
<p>You will get notified instantly when you receive a message, swipe, like, complement, profile view.</p>

<h3>10. Advertisements</h3>
<p>You will receive Google ads by Google AdMob in Card Swiping interface, Photo Gallery and Photo Sharing interface.</p>

<h3>11. Profile Stats</h3>
<p>You can see your profile performance in Stats interface. You can see total Likes, Complements, Profile views, Profile reveals (from fun chat) and V score.<br>
    (V score is a special score for your profile which indicates attractiveness of the profile. These scores are purely generated by people from the community, the app does not interfere by any means.)</p>

    </ul>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #4A4A4A;">Your Responsibilities.</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <li>
            <strong>Your account belongs to you — and so does the responsibility to keep it secure.</strong><br>
            Please do not share the email account with which you have created your Ume account with anyone.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>If you choose to meet someone you connected with on Ume in real life, please note that you are doing so at your own discretion and responsibility.</strong><br>
            We encourage you to take all necessary safety precautions.<br>
            Please remember, if you decide to meet someone from Vivi in real life, you're doing so at your own risk. Vivi cannot take responsibility for what happens offline — so stay safe and meet wisely!
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Be Respectful</strong><br>
            We want Ume to be a safe and welcoming space for everyone.<br>
            That means:
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Treating others with kindness and respect.</li>

    </ul>
</div>

<div style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', sans-serif; padding: 16px; color: #4A4A4A; line-height: 1.6;">

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #0288D1; font-size: 19px;">Additionals</h3>

    <ul style="margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 15px;">
        <li>We do our best to keep the app smooth and bug-free, but we can’t promise perfection. The app is provided “as-is”, and while we work hard, some hiccups may happen.</li>
        <li>We’re not responsible for any harm, loss, or bad experience that may occur through app usage, interactions, or technical issues. That said — we want every moment on Vivi to be awesome, and we’re here to help if something goes wrong.</li>
        <li>We may update these Terms once in a while. If we do, we’ll let you know through the app or email. Continuing to use the app means you agree with the updated terms.</li>
        <li>Ume is not responsible for any events, incidents, or consequences that may occur if you choose to meet someone in person. You assume full responsibility for your actions and interactions outside the app.</li>
        <li>The app may occasionally experience bugs, errors, server downtime, or unexpected behavior. We work actively to fix issues as soon as they’re reported, but we can’t guarantee the app will always function without interruptions. Ume is not liable for any loss, inconvenience, or issues caused by technical problems — including message delivery failures, profile glitches, or connection errors.</li>
    </ul>
